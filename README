We have created "likebook" which is a competitve reaction game which satirizes 
the modern era's infatuation with liking things on the internet.
To start it up, simply run networkHost first on one machine and
networkClient on another (or the same if you like playing with fire)
Use the arrow keys and enter on the Host side to select the game mode.

Within likebook, there are two game modes: original and frenzy.

Original is the more basic game mode. In it, the two users (host and client)
duke it out on a game of preparation, talent, and pure luck. A random amount of
time is assigned (between .5 and 2 seconds) and once this time has passed,
a like button will appear on the screen. It is then a baulderdash to see
who has it in them to beat the other to liking it first. "First!" they might
exclaim. If you are successful in smashing that like button first, you will
see it turn blue and slowly fade away, and watch your score or "likes" increase
by one. However, if you are the unlucky soul to click second, you will
be greeted with a puff and a dissappearance Houdini himself would be impressed
by. As you watch your chances dissipate in thin air, you will notice the number
next to "dislikes" has increased by one - as your opponent is one step closer
to taking you down. Ultimately, it is a race to see who can click the like button
10 times.

Perhaps you would rather play the frenzy mode. In which case, you and your opponent
will be bombarded by like buttons across the screen, each with equal chance to 
snag as many as possible. The puffs will paint your screen as the game goes on, while
you struggle to get any of those beautiful little thumbs to turn blue. It's a race 
to 15 for this one. I wish you good luck, as you will need it.

I would not suggest playing likebook with your friends, or they might not
be your friends for much longer. 
Good luck, and have fun.
